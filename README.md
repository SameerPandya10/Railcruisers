# Railcruisers

Railcruisers is a GUI application made using python GUI library TKinter and MySQL. It is a railway ticket booking portal which provides a personalized platform to the user to make account, book tickets, cancel tickets, etc. It also allows the admin to interact with the database using the GUI.

In order to exprience this GUI application on your system, please approach the following steps: 

  1. Create a folder where you wish to clone the website and open here  
  2. Write the following command in the terminal
      
          git clone https://github.com/SameerPandya10/Railcruisers.git        
        
  3. This will clone all the files into a sub-folder "Railcruisers" in the folder you cloned the website.
  4. Now download mysql on your system and copy the entire data in "MYSQL_Database.txt" file into the workbench/command line client to create the database.
  5. Now open the "Railcruisers/" folder, open cmd here and create a python virtual environment.
  6. Once the virtual environment is created activate the virtual environment and install the necessary python libraries from the "requirements.txt" file using the following command in the "Railcruisers/" folder in command prompt: 
          
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          
  7. This will create and finish the complete setup required for executing this application on your system.
